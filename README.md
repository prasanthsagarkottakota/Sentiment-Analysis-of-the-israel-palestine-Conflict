Project Title : Sentiment Analysis on Israel-Palestine Conflict using Reddit Data

The source code files are jupyter notebook files, most of the installations will be carried out during execution. I used kaggle to run and code the project.

The code files were named as following:
1)reddit-api-script.ipynb -> this is the sorce code to extract data using reddit api
2)sentiment-analysis-on-israel-palestine-reddit.ipynb -> this is the source code, wheer we import and do sentiment analysis on the data .The note book contains all the results and these were documented in report as well

Execution :
1)Import the above files
2)Give the dataset path to the sentiment-analysis-on-israel-palestine-reddit.ipynb, and start running the cells
3)The data can be freshly extracted using api script or you can use the data source file present in the submission

These codes were also available online in kaggle in following links:
